POIC-Net is a novel algorithm designed to identify partially trained objects in 
agentic object detection systems. It is particularly useful for models 
that need to detect incomplete or partially visible objects in images, 
videos, or even parts of speech in text data. 
The algorithm leverages a multi-modal attention mechanism and generative completion networks to infer missing parts of objects or speech, enabling models to make accurate predictions 
even when the input data is incomplete or ambiguous.
