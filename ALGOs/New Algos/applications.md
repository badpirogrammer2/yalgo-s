## Library Usage

YALGO-S is now organized as a Python library that can be installed and used as follows:

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/badpirogrammer2/yalgo-s.git
cd yalgo-s/ALGOs/New\ Algos

# Install the library
pip install -e .
```

### AGMOHD Usage

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
from yalgo_s import AGMOHD

# Define your model
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

model = SimpleModel()

# Create optimizer
optimizer = AGMOHD(model, lr=0.01, beta=0.9)

# Prepare data
X = torch.randn(1000, 10)
y = X.sum(dim=1, keepdim=True) + 0.1 * torch.randn(1000, 1)
dataset = TensorDataset(X, y)
data_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=16)

# Train
loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
trained_model = optimizer.train(data_loader, loss_fn, max_epochs=20)
```

### POIC-NET Usage

```python
import torch
from PIL import Image
from yalgo_s import POICNet

# Create POIC-Net instance
poic_net = POICNet(image_model_name="resnet50", text_model_name="bert")

# Process image only
image = Image.open("path/to/image.jpg")
refined_objects, confidence_scores = poic_net(image, modality="image")

# Process image and text
text = "A partially visible object in the scene"
refined_objects, confidence_scores = poic_net((image, text), modality="image")
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
# Custom model configurations
poic_net = POICNet(
    image_model_name="vgg16",
    text_model_name="gpt2",
    threshold=0.3
)

# Extract features separately
image_features = poic_net.extract_image_features(image)
text_features = poic_net.extract_text_features(text)
```
