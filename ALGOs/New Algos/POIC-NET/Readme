POIC-NET is a cutting-edge multi-modal algorithm designed to identify and complete partially visible objects in agentic object detection systems. It excels at processing incomplete or ambiguous data across multiple modalities (vision, text, audio), making it invaluable for real-world applications where perfect data is rarely available.

The algorithm combines advanced computer vision techniques with generative AI and multi-modal attention mechanisms to:
- **Detect partial objects** with high accuracy
- **Complete missing parts** using contextual information
- **Integrate multiple modalities** for robust understanding
- **Provide uncertainty quantification** for reliable decision-making

print(f"Confidence scores: {confidence_scores}")
```

### Multi-Modal Processing
```python
# Process image with text context

refined_objects, scores = poic_net((image, text_description))

# Process video frames

```python
# Custom model configuration
poic_net = POICNet(
    image_model_name="efficientnet_b7",  # High accuracy
    text_model_name="roberta",          # Better language understanding

# Extract features separately
image_features = poic_net.extract_image_features(image)
text_features = poic_net.extract_text_features(text)

# Manual pipeline control
regions, scores = poic_net.detect_partial_objects(image_features)
completed = poic_net.complete_object(regions[0], image_features)
